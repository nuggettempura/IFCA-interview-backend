### Modules to download before initializing:

```npm install apollo-server type-graphql typeorm reflect-metadata```

1. Apollo Server to build and run our GraphQL server
2. TypeGraphQL to generate our schema from TypeScript classes
3. TypeORM to interact with our SQL database
4. reflect-metadata to work with TypeScript decorators

### Database

Database that was used for this assignment is PostgreSQL installed locally from the device coupled with pgAdmin for GUI for PostgreSQL.

There is a .env.sample file to connect the database to the TypegraphQL with TypeORM. Use the credentials of your localhost using your preferred GUI PostgresQL for better experience in or clearer tabulated data.
